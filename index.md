## The Tukey Keyboard Layout

Named after the famous statistician John Tukey (pronounced too-key). This layout is designed for a minimum 48key, multi-layered, QMK compatible ortholinear keyboard like the [Planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck).

The Tukey layout does away with the assumption that each letter/symbol should occupy only one position on the keyboard. For example, the letters 'O', 'L', 'R', and 'T' appear twice in the image. There is also the addition of a dedicated 'REPEAT' key in the top left corner of the keyboard. 

This duplication of select letters, the repeat key, and the data driven principles that support their design, is what inspired the name 'Tukey'.

### Why Duplicate Keys?

Many layouts are designed to minimize same finger bigrams (SFB's). That is, keys typed sequentially using the same finger. On a QWERTY keyboard for example, 'CE' is a SFB, so is 'DE' and 'RT'. When typing, a SFB takes longer to type than keys typed sequentially using two different fingers. Comparing the two different types of actions, we see that the SFB requires you to press the first key, then raise your finger before moving to and pressing the next key. With two different fingers, pressing a key and positioning your other finger to press the next key can happen at the same time, which results in faster, smoother, and more accurate typing. This is the chief justification for duplicating keys at defferent positions on the keyboard.

Double letter bigrams (DLB's) like 'OO' and 'LL' are also, by convention, same finger bigrams. And as a result of this convention they are inefficient to type. They are also extremely common. In fact, in the aggregate, DLB's account for over 2.5% of all bigrams typed in the english language. That makes them the third most common bigram after 'TH' (3.5%) and 'HE' (3.1%).
